Here are 3 quotes from the transcript that support the summary:

1.  **Brad Ley:** "There's a lot of research out there that shows anywhere in your body you have low oxygen, you have inflammation, and anywhere you have inflammation, you have low oxygen." \[00:00:45-00:00:52] This quote highlights the core principle behind EWOT and its potential to address inflammation, a key factor in many chronic health conditions.
2.  **Dave Asprey:** "So that's one of the things that motivates me to have you on the show is like, let's tell everybody about this. And like, you, like I, I think it's kind of ridiculous. There's one vendor of OT. Charge a huge amount of money for basically a big trash bag." \[00:08:05-00:08:19] This quote emphasizes Dave's motivation for discussing EWOT and his desire to make it more accessible and affordable.
3.  **Brad Ley:** "The most effective oxygen therapy, the most effective wellness modality, regardless, is the one you can do consistently over time. And so. If you can, you know, and that's what I loved about this. It was 15 minutes a day is all it takes to do ot. And if you could bring the price down so people could do it in their home, they didn't need to go to a center. That's something most of us can do." \[00:10:09-00:10:33] This quote underscores the importance of consistency in therapy and the value of making EWOT accessible for home use.

*   **Who:** Brad Pitzele
*   **Evidence/Reasoning:** Brad states that 93% is the medical spec they use.
*   **Attribution:** "Effectively what it does is it takes the air, your breathing, that's at 21% oxygen and it [00:12:40] purifies it to 93% oxygen."

**Claim 11:** The root of all disease is lack of oxygen.

    *   Some users report immediate boosts in energy, mental clarity, and sleep quality.
    *   Others, particularly those with chronic illnesses, may require several weeks or months to notice significant benefits. 
    *   Brad Ley experienced improved endurance and overall health after implementing EWOT.
*   **<attribution>:**
    *   Dave: "[00:02:25] about e watt or exercise with oxygen, oxygen therapy, and it's something I've experimented [00:02:30] with ever since."
    *   Brad: "[00:10:25] 15 minutes a day is all it takes to do ot. And if you could bring the price down so people could do it in their [00:10:30] home, they didn't need to go to a center. That's something most of us can do."
    *   Brad: "[00:17:20] obviously when you start flooding [00:17:25] your tissues with oxygen, you're creating this powerful anti-inflammatory effect, [00:17:30] not just in your capillaries but everywhere."
    *   Brad: "[00:27:35] most noticeable results. We have folks who get on and immediately they noticed a, a, a [00:27:40] boost in energy, in clear headedness, uh, and, and in sleep quality."

**2. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT)**

*   **Description:** HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber. It is mentioned as an alternative or complementary therapy to EWOT.
*   **Brad's Experience:** Brad initially considered HBOT but found it too expensive and time-consuming.
*   **Dave's Experience:** Dave has used both soft-sided and hard-sided hyperbaric chambers for brain injury and other health benefits.
*   **<attribution>:**
    *   Brad: "[00:05:25] You either need to try hyperbaric [00:05:30] oxygen. Or you need to try exercise with oxygen therapy."
