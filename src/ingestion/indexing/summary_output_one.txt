*   "Increasing metabolic demand in a very high oxygen environment has unique [00:00:05] metabolic benefits that turn off, in some cases, tons of autoimmune inflammation." (Dave, setting the stage for the discussion on EWOT's benefits)
*   "Necessity is the mother of all invention, and mine was nonetheless. Um, [00:03:40] I had weird autoimmune conditions my whole life. And then [00:03:45] in 2010 timeframe I was diagnosed with autoimmune [00:03:50] arthritis, and it started to get progressively worse." (Brad, explaining his motivation for exploring EWOT)
*   "There's a lot of [00:17:05] research out there that shows anywhere in your body [00:17:15] you have low oxygen, you have inflammation. Anywhere you have [00:17:20] inflammation, you have low oxygen, you can't have one without the other." (Brad, explaining the link between oxygen and inflammation)
*   "The most effective oxygen therapy, the most effective [00:10:15] wellness modality, regardless, is the one you can do consistently over time." (Brad, emphasizing the importance of accessibility and affordability)
*   "My view on things has just only gotten stronger over the years that [00:45:55] autoimmune issues are ultimately mitochondrial. You fix the mitochondria, [00:46:00] drop the stress response, the cell danger response, and you fix everything." (Dave, summarizing the underlying mechanism of EWOT's benefits)
